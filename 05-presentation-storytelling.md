# My design story

***Introduction***

* Hello. My name is Lukas Hunter. Since I started to learn design, I tried to be an optimistic designer, I believed that there is a way for anything. I like to solve problems through the process of searching for new ideas on how to solve key issues. But what if there is a problem? What if you can't come up with something creative? How can you make things look interesting and not just bland? Well, you put some flags into it! That's right, flags! But who in their right mind would use flags? How did I come up with this? Well, here is the full story.

***First there were maps...***

* When I was little, I discovered a School Atlas book on my table. I started reading through the atlas book and it fascinated me. I would like to look at maps. I found maps very interesting. The idea that you could look at a certain country through simple visualization using lines was amazing. It's like you had the whole world in your hands. When I looked at a certain country, I would be amazed by all the unique city names that country had. It made me want to learn more, research more about the country. So I started looking on the internet. I started to excell in geography. *nerd alert!*

***Then came the internet...***

* So I searched on the internet and started to learn more about a certain country's history and culture. Not in full detail, but enough to get an idea on how a country functions and what are the main characteristics of it. But then I saw their flags. Before I got into flags, I've only seen them as simple squares with some random shapes on them that are being represented on a piece of cloth. But the truth it, they're something more. There's one thing that a flag and a map have in common. And that is, that they're both represent a country using symbols bordered by a rectangluras shape, although in different ways. They're both represent a country in a certain visual style. They both include an information about a country. The information describes the country in a simple minimalist form. 

***And later came flags***

* The study of flags is called vexillology. I was introduced to this funny word in 2014 when I was searching the internet. Like most of people still to this day, I had no idea such a word existed. And so it made me want to research more. I started looking into the symbolism of each country flag. I learned that the most common colours on flags are red, white and blue. Red symbolizes the blood that was spilled during a certain countries revolution, blue symbolizes the waters and white symbolizing peace. Perhaps these colours are telling us a perception of how what we want for the world. Peace and nature, while valuing our struggles in history. 

***My personal flag***

* Here is an example of my case study. The work is a personal flag that I created during my second semester at my graphic design school. The task was to create a unique selfie that would describe our personality so I created my own personal flag thatâ€™s hanging on a flag pole in the sky. The colours yellow and black represent optimism and pessimism. In the middle of the flag is a green eye representing the colours of my eyes. The two triangles represent the different views I take to seeing graphic design.The triangle on the left side is a simple triangle in blue which is my personal favourite colour. On the right side is a more complex triangle using different colours. The whole composition symbolizes how you can make creative ideas from simple things by visualising the idea through your own personal vision with your eyes and turn the idea into something new and unique.
