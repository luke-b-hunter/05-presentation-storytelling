# My design story

***Introduction***

* Hello. My name is Lukas Hunter. Since I started to learn design, I tried to be an optimistic designer, I believed that there is a way for anything. I like to solve problems through the process of searching for new ideas on how to solve key issues. But what if there is a problem? What if you can't come up with something creative? How can you make things look interesting and not just bland? Well, you put some flags into it! That's right, flags! But who in their right mind would use flags? How did I come up with this? Well, here is the full story.

***First there were maps...***

* When I was little, I discovered a School Atlas book on my table. I started reading through the atlas book and it fascinated me. I would like to look at maps. I found maps very interesting. The idea that you could look at a certain country through simple visualization using lines was amazing. It's like you had the whole world in your hands. When I looked at a certain country, I would be amazed by all the unique city names that country had. It made me want to learn more, research more about the country. So I started looking on the internet. I started to excell in geography. *nerd alert!*

***Then came the internet...***

* So I searched on the internet and started to learn more about a certain country's history and culture. Not in full detail, but enough to get an idea on how a country functions and what are the main characteristics of it. But then I saw their flags. Before I got into flags, I've only seen them as simple squares with some random shapes on them that are being represented on a piece of cloth. But the truth it, they're something more. There's one thing that a flag and a map have in common. And that is, that they're both represent a country using symbols bordered by a rectangluras shape, although in different ways. They're both represent a country in a certain visual style. They both include an information about a country. The information describes the country in a simple minimalist form. 

***And later came flags***
